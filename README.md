# WordPress Honeypot Plugin

A very simple WordPress plugin that creates a honeypot for spam bots.

## What's a honeypot?

A honeypot is a hidden input field created to trick spam bots. Normal users
won't see this field, but spam bots may try to fill it. If the honeypot field is
filled, the comment was likely generated by a spam bot and the comment will be
marked as spam.

## Honeypots offer limited protection

The honeypot created by this plugin is very basic and can be easily circumvented
by certain spam bots. The goal of this plugin is not to be a full solution
against spam but simply to make your blog a *slightly* more difficult target for
spammers.

## No CAPTCHAs

This plugin does not add CAPTCHAs to the form due to accessibility concerns and
increased friction for legitimate users trying to contribute to the blog.
